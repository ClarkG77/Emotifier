# Emotifier
### Note Emotifier use the Python 3.9 and the most recent versions of scipy, cv2, skimage, and PyQt5 if the build does not work it is likely a result of missing one of these packages.


# How to use each feature of the Emotifier:

## **Select Image:**
To first select an image click on the upload button and then the you will be prompted to select an image from the file explorer the image can be a .jpg, .png, or .bmp

After an image is selected the user can now perform any of the other functions on the image.


## **Pixelize:**
Pixelizing an image will result in the image having colors averaged and be displayed in larger pixels than the image. This function can be modified by using the window size feature. 

Window size takes in an integer for window size for the size of the resulting pixels in pixelize.
